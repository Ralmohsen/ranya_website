Novelty detection is the problem of identifying whether a new data point is considered
to be an inlier or an outlier. We assume that training data is available to
describe only the inlier distribution. Recent approaches primarily leverage deep
encoder-decoder network architectures to compute a reconstruction error that is
used to either compute a novelty score or to train a one-class classifier. While
we too leverage a novel network of that kind, we take a probabilistic approach
and effectively compute how likely it is that a sample was generated by the inlier
distribution. We achieve this with two main contributions. First, we make the
computation of the novelty probability feasible because we linearize the parameterized
manifold capturing the underlying structure of the inlier distribution, and
show how the probability factorizes and can be computed with respect to local
coordinates of the manifold tangent space. Second, we improve the training of the
autoencoder network. An extensive set of results show that the approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.
