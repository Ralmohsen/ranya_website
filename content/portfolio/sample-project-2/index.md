Learning the manifold of a complex distribution is a fundamental
challenge for novelty or anomaly detection. We
introduce a revised learning and inference procedure that
takes into account a key underlying assumption made by the
framework of generative probabilistic novelty detection. The
traditional framework implies the ability to not only learn
the manifold of the generative distribution of inliers but
also to compute non-linear orthogonal projections onto this
manifold from the ambient space. We augment the original
training with priors that endow the model with this property,
and prove that inference becomes easier and computationally
more efficient. We show experimentally that the new
framework leads to improved and more stable results.
