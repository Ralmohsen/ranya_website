Current approaches to novelty or anomaly detection are
based on deep neural networks. Despite their effectiveness,
neural networks are also vulnerable to imperceptible deformations of the input data. This is a serious issue in critical applications, or when data alterations are generated by
an adversarial attack. While this is a known problem that
has been studied in recent years for the case of supervised
learning, the case of novelty detection has received very limited attention. Indeed, in this latter setting the learning is
typically unsupervised because outlier data is not available
during training, and new approaches for this case need to
be investigated. We propose a new prior that aims at learning a robust likelihood for the novelty test, as a defense
against attacks. We also integrate the same prior with a
state-of-the-art novelty detection approach. Because of the
geometric properties of that approach, the resulting robust
training is computationally very efficient.
