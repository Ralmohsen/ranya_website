A deep learning approach to solving the problem of open-set recognition, by leveraging an encoder-decoder network architecture in conjunction with a multi-class classifier.
The network enables learning a novelty detector that computes the probability of a sample to belong to one of the known classes versus being unknown.
If known, the multi-class classifiers assigns the class label to the sample.
