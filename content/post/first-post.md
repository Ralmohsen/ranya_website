### Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important to safety-critical machine learning applications and has been extensively studies with different methods.
### However, from the problem setting, OOD detection is closely related to other fields including anomaly detection (AD), Novelty detection (NV), open
### set recognition (OSR), and Outlier detection (OD). In this post I am summarizing the [[Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Survey]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11334)
