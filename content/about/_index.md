This is my about page. :wave:

I am a PhD Candidate in Computer science in the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at WVU.
I work on Computer Vision lab at WVU. My focus is on developing intelligent algorithms that enhance the performance of representation learning, open-set classification and novelty detection.
I spent most of my time at the vision lab, but if I have time you can find my hiking or exploring our mother earth :earth_africa:
